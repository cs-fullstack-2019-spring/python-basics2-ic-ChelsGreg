Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 1:
Create a function that has two variables. One called greeting and nother called myName. Print out greeting and myName two different ways <strong>without</strong> using the following examples
```
print(greeting + myName)
pring(greeting, myName)
```

### Problem 2:
Create a function that asks the user for a secret password. Create a loop that quits with the user's quit word. If the user doesn't enter that word, ask them to guess again.

### Problem 3:
Create a function that prints 0 to 100 three times in a row (vertically).

### Problem 4:
Create a random number. Ask the user to guess the random number. Keep letting the user guess until they get it right, then quit.

### Challenge
Ask the user to create a number for the computer to guess. Create random numbers until the computer gets that number. Once it guesses the number, alert the user how many times it took to guess the random number.
